Case:
[16,21,11,8,12,22] -> Merge Sort
1. Write down the array's steps the array which is above to sort type.
2. Show the Big-O notion.


Solution:
1. 
[16,21,11]   [8,12,22]
[16]  [21,11]   [8,12]  [22]
[16]  [11,21]   [8,12]  [22]
[11,16,21]   [8,12,22]
[8,11,12,16,21,22]

2. 
Big-O notion is O(nlogn)
